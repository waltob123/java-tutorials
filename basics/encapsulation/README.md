# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is protecting data of a class so it cannot be accessed outside of the class.
To protect the data we use the `private` key work.

Example
```{java}
class Phone {
    private int wifiSpeed;
}
```

NB: To set the value of a private variable, we use methods (getters and setters).
