# Final Keyword

The `final` keyword is used to make variables constant. Meaning, the values for these variables 
cannot change.

The `final` keyword can also be used with classes.
It prevents your class from being extended to other classes.

The `final` keyword is also used with methods to prevent `method overriding` from subclasses.
