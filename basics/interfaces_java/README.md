/**
 * README - Java Interfaces
 * 
 * This README provides a detailed explanation of Java interfaces and how to implement them.
 * 
 * What is a Java Interface?
 * 
 * A Java interface is a collection of abstract methods. It defines a contract that a class
 * must adhere to if it implements the interface. Interfaces can also contain constant fields.
 * 
 * How to Implement a Java Interface:
 * 
 * To implement a Java interface, a class must use the "implements" keyword followed by the
 * interface name. The class must provide implementations for all the abstract methods defined
 * in the interface.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * public interface MyInterface {
 *     void method1();
 *     int method2();
 * }
 * 
 * public class MyClass implements MyInterface {
 *     public void method1() {
 *         // Implementation for method1
 *     }
 *     
 *     public int method2() {
 *         // Implementation for method2
 *         return 0;
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * Additional Information:
 * 
 * - Interfaces can extend other interfaces using the "extends" keyword.
 * - A class can implement multiple interfaces.
 * - Interfaces can be used to achieve abstraction and provide a common contract for classes.
 * - Interfaces can be used to achieve multiple inheritance-like behavior in Java.
 * 
 * Example of interface extension and multiple interface implementation:
 * 
 * public interface MyExtendedInterface extends MyInterface {
 *     void method3();
 * }
 * 
 * public class MyExtendedClass implements MyInterface, MyExtendedInterface {
 *     public void method1() {
 *         // Implementation for method1
 *     }
 *     
 *     public int method2() {
 *         // Implementation for method2
 *         return 0;
 *     }
 *     
 *     public void method3() {
 *         // Implementation for method3
 *     }
 * }
 *
