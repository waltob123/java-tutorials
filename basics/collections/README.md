## Introduction

Java Collections framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to store and manipulate groups of objects. It is designed to be efficient, flexible, and easy to use.

## List

A List is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate values. Some commonly used List implementations are ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

## Set

A Set is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Some commonly used Set implementations are HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

## Map

A Map is a collection that stores key-value pairs. It does not allow duplicate keys. Some commonly used Map implementations are HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

## Queue

A Queue is a collection that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. Some commonly used Queue implementations are LinkedList and PriorityQueue.

## Usage

To use Java Collections in your project, you need to import the appropriate classes and interfaces from the `java.util` package. Here's an example:
