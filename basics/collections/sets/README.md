# Java Sets README
## Introduction
Welcome to the Java Sets README! This document provides an overview of the different types of sets available in Java, which are part of the java.util package. Sets are a fundamental data structure in Java that store unique elements. They do not allow duplicate elements and provide efficient methods for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements.

## HashSet
## Overview
HashSet is one of the most commonly used set implementations in Java. It uses a hash table to store elements, providing constant-time performance for basic operations such as add, remove, and contains. However, the order of elements in a HashSet is not guaranteed.

Example Usage
```{java}
Copy code
Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
hashSet.add("Apple");
hashSet.add("Banana");
hashSet.add("Orange");

System.out.println(hashSet); // Output: [Orange, Banana, Apple]
```
## LinkedHashSet
## Overview
LinkedHashSet is similar to HashSet but maintains the order of elements in which they were inserted. It achieves this by using a doubly-linked list to store the elements in addition to a hash table for quick access.

Example Usage
```{java}
Copy code
Set<String> linkedHashSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();
linkedHashSet.add("Apple");
linkedHashSet.add("Banana");
linkedHashSet.add("Orange");

System.out.println(linkedHashSet); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
```
## TreeSet
## Overview
TreeSet is a set that is sorted in natural order or according to a specified comparator during its construction. It is implemented as a Red-Black tree, providing O(log n) time complexity for basic operations.

Example Usage
```{java}
Copy code
Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
treeSet.add("Apple");
treeSet.add("Banana");
treeSet.add("Orange");

System.out.println(treeSet); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
```


## EnumSet
## Overview
EnumSet is a specialized implementation of a set for use with enumeration types (enum). It is more efficient than other general-purpose sets when dealing with enum elements.

Example Usage
```{java}
Copy code
enum Days { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }

Set<Days> enumSet = EnumSet.of(Days.MONDAY, Days.WEDNESDAY, Days.FRIDAY);

System.out.println(enumSet); // Output: [MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY]
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Java offers a variety of set implementations to suit different use cases. Choose the appropriate set type based on your specific requirements, such as order preservation, sorting, or efficient handling of enum types. Experiment with these sets to enhance the performance and clarity of your Java applications. Happy coding!
