/**
 * This class demonstrates the usage of annotations in Java.
 * Annotations provide metadata about the code and can be used
 * for various purposes such as compile-time checks, code generation,
 * and runtime processing.
 *
 * <p>Annotations are declared using the "@" symbol followed by the
 * annotation name. They can be applied to classes, methods, fields,
 * and other program elements.
 *
 * <p>This class provides examples of commonly used annotations in Java,
 * including @Override, @Deprecated, and @SuppressWarnings.
 *
